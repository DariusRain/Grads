# The Graduate Project.
<br>

## ðŸŽ“Grads - By Darius Rain.

## About project:
Create a full stack application using Express Mongoose Pug and Nodejs. <br>
This application will be used to display a users job history & education information to companies <br>
who may be searching to fill a certain job title. (Sounds a little like Linkedin ðŸ¤£) <br>
I want to make this application to have a simpler method than Linkedin, in order to find potential employees. 
So A company can just simply search and find who they are looking for <br>
similar to a google search rather than having a social media aspect compared to Linkedin. <br>
